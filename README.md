# Flutter Web

Flutter Web is an extension of Google’s open-source Flutter framework, designed to enable developers to build highly interactive, responsive web applications from a single codebase. Launched as part of Flutter’s multi-platform strategy, Flutter Web allows apps to run on web browsers alongside other Flutter-supported platforms like iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and Linux. Using Flutter Web, developers can leverage Flutter’s rich widget catalog and fast rendering capabilities to create visually appealing and performant web applications without compromising user experience.

## Key Features of Flutter Web

### 1: Single Codebase
Write once and run on both mobile and web platforms.
### 2: Rich UI
Flutter Web leverages Skia, a high-performance graphics engine, to render custom, adaptive UIs.

### 3: Responsive Layouts
Built-in support for responsive layouts allows applications to adjust seamlessly across devices and screen sizes.

### 4: Plugins & Packages
Use Flutter packages for the web, although some mobile-specific packages might need web alternatives.
